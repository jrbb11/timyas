## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Integration**
- Uses existing `audit_logs` and `security_events` tables
- Leverages `get_audit_trail` RPC function
- Integrates with `AuditService` for data operations

### **Frontend Architecture**
- **React Components**: Modern functional components with hooks
- **State Management**: useState and useEffect for local state
- **Permission System**: Integrated with RBAC system
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic data refresh

### **Security Features**
- **Permission Guards**: All components protected by RBAC
- **Data Filtering**: User-specific data access
- **Audit Logging**: All actions logged for compliance
- **Session Management**: Secure user context

## ðŸ“Š **Key Metrics Tracked**

### **Security Metrics**
- Total security events
- Critical alerts count
- Warning alerts count
- Resolved vs unresolved alerts
- Failed login attempts
- Permission denials

### **User Activity Metrics**
- Total user actions
- Unique IP addresses
- Device types (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop)
- Top actions performed
- Most accessed resources
- Time-based activity patterns

### **Compliance Metrics**
- Compliance score (0-100%)
- Data change events
- Security event frequency
- Export activities
- User authentication events

## ðŸš€ **Navigation Integration**

### **Routes Added**
```typescript
route("security/alerts", "pages/protected/SecurityAlerts.tsx"),
route("security/user-activity", "pages/protected/UserActivityMonitor.tsx"),
route("security/compliance", "pages/protected/ComplianceReports.tsx"),
```

### **Sidebar Menu**
- Security Dashboard
- Audit Trail
- Security Alerts
- User Activity
- Compliance Reports

## ðŸ”’ **Permission Requirements**

### **Security Dashboard**
- Resource: `security`
- Action: `read`

### **Audit Trail**
- Resource: `audit`
- Action: `read`

### **Security Alerts**
- Resource: `security`
- Action: `read`

### **User Activity Monitor**
- Resource: `audit`
- Action: `read`

### **Compliance Reports**
- Resource: `audit`
- Action: `export`

## ðŸ“ˆ **Performance Considerations**

### **Optimization Strategies**
- **Pagination**: Large datasets paginated for performance
- **Filtering**: Server-side filtering to reduce data transfer
- **Caching**: Client-side caching for frequently accessed data
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data only when needed
- **Debouncing**: Search inputs debounced to reduce API calls

### **Data Limits**
- Audit logs: 1000 records per request
- Security events: 100 records per request
- User activities: Processed client-side for performance

## ðŸŽ¯ **User Experience**

### **Interface Design**
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional design
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all device sizes
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Easy-to-use interface
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data refresh
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states

### **Accessibility**
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Screen Reader**: ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG compliant colors
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus indicators

## ðŸ”„ **Integration Points**

### **Existing Systems**
- **RBAC System**: Permission-based access control
